## User Experience
 
### Design

#### Typography

#### Icons

##### Book Reader

The book-open-reader icon from fontawesome was selected for the logo because it fits well with the theme of a book club. This is because it shows a person reading from a book and helps provide context to first time users. The solid version was selected because it displays best against the headers green background.

##### Home Icon

The house icon from fontawesome was selected for the home link icon because it is one of the most universally used and easily recognised. The solid version displays best alongside the other links. 

##### Library Icon

The book icon from fontawesome was selected for the call to action button in the hero image and library link. The closed book is to represent the fact you have not yet opened the library. It also makes the button more interesting and eye-catching to the user. 

##### Library Title Icon

The book open icon from fontawesome was selected for the library page heading. This is different from the links to convey to the user they have opened the library page. It displays well in the heading and makes it more interesting.

##### Edit Icon

The pen to square icon from fontawesome was selected for all edit buttons because it is a well known symbol used to convey the purpose of the button. It looks clean and professional where used.

##### Contact Icon

The phone icon from fontawesome was selected for the contact link because it is a good way of letting the user know they will be able to find the telephone number and ways to get in touch with the club. The solid version looks good with the other links. 

##### Facebook

The square facebook icon from fontawesome was selected for the link because it displays better against the footers green background. It is clear to the user what it represents and that it will redirect them to facebook should they click it. It matches the other icons from the footer.

##### Instagram

The square instagram icon from fontawesome was selected for the link because it displays better against the footers green background. It is clear to the user what it represents and that it will redirect them to instagram should they click it. It matches the other icons for the footer.

##### X

The square X icon from fontawesome was selected for the link because it displays better against the footers green background. It is clear to the user what it represents and that it will redirect them to X should they click it. It matches the other icons for the footer.

##### Tik Tok

The tik tok icon from fontawesome was selected for the link because it also displays well against the footers green background. It too is clear to the user what is represents and that it will direct them to tik tok should they click it. Unfortunately fontawesome does not have a square version of the logo but it still looks good alongside the others.
